<h1>The Tweet Processing Process:</h1>

Subject: Apple Inc.

Check for Definitions that will pull unrelated tweets.
Apple Inc. -> subtract out company identifiers ("Corporation", "Inc", "Company")
	look for common terms ("bank", ..) because the work bank shows up a lot and its many definitions will be commonly confused for lots of banks

apple- a fruit... how to detect this kind of apple......find tweets with "apple" and sort out into 3 groups: fruit, company or niether.  Then look for common words..
Then search specifically for tweets that contain something like "apple"+"fruit" and find words like "seed" or "doctor away" to strengthen the list. and use a bayesian probability model to guess chance that its a fruit or a company related tweet.
Capital letters are important as long as not beginning of sentence (auto-capitalized), Apple will mean company while apple means fruit 999.9% of time
